# Heart Disease Prediction Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset to explore relationships between various factors and the presence of heart disease. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the implementation of several machine learning models for heart disease prediction.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset, which contains various attributes related to heart health. The target variable has been simplified to a binary classification: 0 for no heart disease and 1 for the presence of heart disease.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Implementation of multiple machine learning models:
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Naive Bayes
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - AdaBoost
  - Gradient Boosting
  - XGBoost
- Stacking ensemble method

## Usage
1. Ensure all required libraries are installed.
2. Run the Jupyter notebook to see the analysis and results.

## Key Visualizations
- Age distribution by heart disease status
- Relationship between age, sex, and heart disease

## Model Performance
The notebook includes accuracy scores for both training and test sets for each model implemented.
